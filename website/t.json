responsibility and i'm going to say that our responsibility is to have a browser that doesn't fucking excuse me that doesn't blow all of our information out there and and this is why i like the brave

it's"},{"speaker":"spk_1","text":"an advertising break block"},{"speaker":"spk_4","text":"as they block ads and then you go to like certain publications have you going down and like a news list to get some ideas"},{"speaker":"spk_1","text":"there's a"},{"speaker":"spk_4","text":"lot of these autumn actually most of the newspapers that hey hey you're using an ad blocker hey and then they you know that you have two options of some like the storm zone block on"},{"speaker":"spk_1","text":"this page for this moment"},{"speaker":"spk_4","text":"if they both for was just cut you out now you get rid the ad blocker We're not fooling around with brave What brave does is it somehow signals the publication that hey now there's No ad blocker No And then then it takes the itself takes he has and buries them someplace where you never seen it's Probably that some sort of a virtual ad blocking it Proxies"},{"speaker":"spk_1","text":"Ok that's what"},{"speaker":"spk_4","text":"i meant by proxy"},{"speaker":"spk_1","text":"actual the tcp into the into the bit bucket And so"},{"speaker":"spk_4","text":"you just never seen gone"},{"speaker":"spk_1","text":"Yeah

good browser but the idea"},{"speaker":"spk_5","text":"they have behind it"},{"speaker":"spk_1","text":"Is ah week we will crunch the numbers in our own browser and then we'll make a set of what they call indications available to companies and advertisers saying ok i'll give an indication if i'm no now interested in in some kind of sports related thing a bit but it would never be the raw data it would be our own version of what they use internally in their you know their thousand points of light of data points you know Ah white male old guy straight looks at you know the sailboats that's their that's their data points that we would have them that's the thing all you need is that why you need a lot more but having our own browser that you control what you're sending and this is the start where they already think they're serving you ads and we're already effectively filtering them out win for us"},{"speaker":"spk_4","text":"works for me Yeah"},{"speaker":"spk_1","text":"i watched

what people purchase online"},{"speaker":"spk_3","text":"if"},{"speaker":"spk_0","text":"it share it with us but congress"},{"speaker":"spk_5","text":"because it has a share button so it's it's it's

simple and that is to punish those responsible for this particular attack to impose costs and by way of those costs attempted to turf future attacks and if that's the objective from that flows tasks

the the u s president though who's a polled by what they've seen in tow round of these pictures coming from duma we've had condemnation from president macron likewise from prime minister theresa me too if it isn't the sort of military action that you've just outlined there what should be the response to this use off chemical weapons if it's proved the correct response is obviously on i think a child could see this to get inspectors onto the alleged fight of the alleged offend fifth difficult for an hour then what Because of course when we know that assad has form on this we've had investigations previously on there has been fairly conclusive proof that chemical agents have been used uh i don't think that assad is in the least worried that the inspectors would find out his guilt because he's probably not guilty at least on this occasion way have to engage our brains as well as our emotions here not be stampeded by those videos which described this being on verified but which

about that testimony had didn't wash it at the time but it was brought to my attention later and people were raising it with me and my first response was what you know what where what is the issue here you know i remember specifically talking with him as we talked about sensitive things on a number of occasions you know we often would have to discuss sensitive matters sensitive issues terrorism and the like you know law enforcement policy and the like on this one and the life of investigation is everyone knew on the issue when he and i sat down at that time which i think was really in the fall of twenty fifteen was whether or not we were ready is the department to confirm an investigation going on when we typically do not confirm or deny investigations into anything with rare exceptions but comey's as you want to call it the clinton matter he once called the clinton investigation to the extent though that he noted it that it bothered him and if you go to you and question your credibility with regard to the clinton case well yeah i can tell you that you know it was a medium like any other that we that we had had where we talked about the issues that we had a full and open discussion about it even raising the concern and concerns were not raised"},{"speaker":"spk_2","text":"uh here i am a"},{"speaker":"spk_0","text":"liar yeah first"},{"speaker":"spk_2","text":"of

odd"},{"speaker":"spk_0","text":""},{"speaker":"spk_2","text":"very odd and but and i have first the introductory clip which is cnn which is raiding the lawyer's office You can play that We have to give up breaking news just in the"},{"speaker":"spk_1","text":"new york times just reported that the fbi today raided the offices of president trump's longtime attorney michael cohen seizing records related to multiple topics including on that payment to adult film actress stormy daniels alleged hush money the new york times also reporting that the fbi also seized e mails tax documents and business records and that the records include communications between michael cohen the president's attorney and president trump which would likely require a special team of agents to review because conversations with lawyers and clients are protected In most instances this is a breaking news story My panel is here with me special breaking news on and react and let me start with you bill Bill kristol the fact that the fbi apparently with a referral from bob mueller the special counsel eyes rating michael cohen's offices seems rather significant and i assume they would need a warrant to do that which means the judge would have had to have felt And i'm not a lawyers that are probably to this but some reasonable reason to do this The afraid can't just go read officers later zone so that's Interesting What Hey judge found that there was some reason to take a look at these records and cohen's office"},{"speaker":"spk_2","text":"Yeah What What What was the reason Well i think i found the reason Hey uh even over is all bent out of shape about this It seems as if mueller decided that there was a crime committed and he had to report us when he gave it over to the fbi and then they busted in and got and here is the here is the only rational i think that actually makes sense as opposed to all they're just doing a fishing expedition to try and get the goods on trump pounding as anything do with trump i think it's a situation where mueller as a law enforcement officer had to report a particular crime and it's kind of a joke what this crime is but is why bust the lawyer One theory"},{"speaker":"spk_0","text":"it's still unclear what the fbi was looking for bank fraud regarding the payment"},{"speaker":"spk_2","text":"to stormy daniels has been suggested sources tell fox news cohen"},{"speaker":"spk_0","text":"paid daniels from an existing home equity line of credit and that he didn't need to tell the bank what the money was for one hundred thirty thousand dollars was"},{"speaker":"spk_2","text":"then transferred to an llc solely"},{"speaker":"spk_0","text":"owned by cohen and from there wired to an attorney beverly hay wire"},{"speaker":"spk_3","text":"fraud president"},{"speaker":"spk_0","text":"trump denies any knowledge of the transaction"},{"speaker":"spk_2","text":"Wire fraud oh i think wire fraud may be in part of it but i think the main thing is bank fraud the man what does he had it he took out a loan home equity loan which you only do to improve your property or generally speaking and maybe you could take it out for any old reasons what he claims more than wire fraud may be a fallback but it's something like that it's got nothing to do with trump or the russian that is probably some tax implications somewhere along the line with a policy in the middle because through you just shut up yeah well i'll deal he's going on oh i got the money i didn't trump did nothing to do with it when you just shut up he's a lawyer he knows better yeah he's not a good lawyer and it does that if you can't shut up but that's what's concerning you know this is the the people the president surrounds himself with the morons well maybe you got an upgrade here there Ah well i would be remiss without telling you what the american public is not only really interested in but they're excited"},{"speaker":"spk_3","text":"and you know apparently
